Variable fonts is a new technology still undergoning development.

Support for variable fonts is limited as of late 2018 but support
is quickly arriving in web browsers, operating systems and

If you're in doubt or uncertain about variable fonts, then you
probably don't need to use a variable font, and you can ignore the
