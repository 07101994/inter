Variable fonts is a new technology still undergoing development.

Support for variable fonts is limited as of late 2018, but support
is quickly arriving to web browsers, operating systems and
design application.

If you're in doubt or uncertain about variable fonts, then you
probably don't need to use a variable font, and you can ignore
files which name contains ".var"
